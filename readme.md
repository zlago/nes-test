### nes-test

heck if i know hopefully a game by the end

### compiling

uhh [ca65 and ld65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65), everything else should be in the repo?

### source

the source code is not your typical NES asm

i put\* extra effort into making this insanely sane (\*i think..)

which may turn out to not be very readable to the average 2a03 enjoyer

also the code may be a little too safe to be reusable (see: irq.65)
